# Goals for this project

[ ] migrate goals to web page
[ ] create a blog for my first year working from home
[ ] keep daily log of accomplishments and major set backs


## Current Work

- allow for markdown text


## To Keep In Mind

- for daily log, I like being able to edit locally with git pull git push
