# Goals for this project

[ ] migrate goals to web page
[ ] create a blog for my first year working from home
[ ] keep daily log of accomplishments and major set backs


## Current Work

- explore blog templates - [word press theme for blog](https://colorlib.com/wp/template/suppablog/)
- allow for markdown text [ old but promising ](https://www.imzjy.com/blog/2018-05-20-render-the-markdown-in-django) 


## To Keep In Mind

- for daily log, I like being able to edit locally with git pull git push
